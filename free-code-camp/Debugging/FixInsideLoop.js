/* The following function is supposed to create a two-dimensional array with m rows and n columns of zeroes. Unfortunately, 
it's not producing the expected output because the row variable isn't being reinitialized (set back to an empty array) 
in the outer loop. Fix the code so it returns a correct 3x2 array of zeroes, which looks like [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]. */
